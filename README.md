# Corvus
Corvus is a compiler front end that targets Python, Go, and LLVM. All languages supported by Corvus are interoperable (see wiki), and code can be imported and called seamlessly across the different languages.

### Currently Supported Languages
- TBA

### Future Languages
- Pica
- Laevis
- Nymph

## Documentation
Documentation will be provided once more progress is made. Corvus is still in a very early development stage. Currently the Python transpiler is being worked on, with Go to follow and LLVM after that.

## Trivia
The name Pica comes from the genus name for the black-billed magpie (Pica hudsonia) which is very prevalent at the university I'm attending.
